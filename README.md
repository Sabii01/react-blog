# React + Vite

it's a blog website created using react.js with vite and deployed on vercel, the backend is directly integrated through open source service named appwrite

Hope you will like my work, instead of focusing on design my first and foremost plan was to improve it's functionality 

The given link will direct you to the website which is live and working right now:
